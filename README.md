# TGRA_EcoNetwork_Resilience
Multi-temporal Ecological Network Dataset and Resilience Simulation Code for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area 
This dataset presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of ecological network resilience in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) at three key time points: 2001 (pre-dam operation), 2012 (after initial impoundment), and 2023 (reflecting long-term operational adjustments and ecological restoration efforts). The data content includes fundamental geographic information layers (TGRA boundary, Digital Elevation Model (DEM)), and derived ecological network components (ecological source areas, ecological corridors, and ecological stepping stones). Furthermore, the dataset provides a quantitative assessment of ecological network resilience using four core metrics: Average Clustering Coefficient (ACC), Average Number of Independent Paths (ANIP), Network Efficiency, and Relative Size of the Largest Connected Component (RS-LCC). To further enhance the dataset's utility, MATLAB code for simulating various disturbance scenarios (such as random attacks and targeted attacks) is included to evaluate the network's dynamic robustness.
